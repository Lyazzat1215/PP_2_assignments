Numbers
 
 numeric types:
 int  x=1
 float  y=3.2
 complex  z=1j
 
 to verify types:
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))

Int-or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.
 Ex:
x=1
y=81736648665783
z=-5465786
 
Float-or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.
Ex:
x=1.10
y=1.0
z=-35.59

Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.
x = 35e3
y = 12E4
z = -87.7e100

Complex-numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:
x = 3+5j
y = 5j
z = -5j

Conversation: notes: You cannot convert complex numbers into another number type.
x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex

#convert from int to float:
a = float(x)

#convert from float to int:
b = int(y)

#convert from int to complex:
c = complex(x)

print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
