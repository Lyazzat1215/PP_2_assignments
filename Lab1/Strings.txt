Strings:
Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
'hello' is the same as "hello".
Ex:
print("Hello")
print('Hello')

Quotes Inside Quotes:
print("It's alright")
print("He is called 'Johnny'")
print('He is called "Johnny"')

String like a var:
a = "Hello"
print(a)
     And
a = """Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
consectetur adipiscing elit,
sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt
ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.""" #or use 3 single quotes
print(a)   

Strings are arrays:
Get the character at position 1 (remember that the first character has the position 0):
a = "Hello, World!"
print(a[1])
 
Looping:
Loop through the letters in the word "banana":
for x in "banana":
  print(x)

Length:
The len() function returns the length of a string:
a = "Hello, World!"
print(len(a))


Checking string:
Check if "free" is present in the following text:
txt = "The best things in life are free!"
print("free" in txt)
      Or
Print only if "free" is present:
txt = "The best things in life are free!"
if "free" in txt:
  print("Yes, 'free' is present.")
  
If NOT
Check if "expensive" is NOT present in the following text:
txt = "The best things in life are free!"
print("expensive" not in txt)
     Or
print only if "expensive" is NOT present:
txt = "The best things in life are free!"
if "expensive" not in txt:
  print("No, 'expensive' is NOT present.")
