Remove- Loop List Items 
#Remove "banana":
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.remove("banana")
print(thislist)

#Remove the first occurrence of "banana":
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "banana", "kiwi"]
thislist.remove("banana")
print(thislist)

#The pop() method removes the specified index.

#The del keyword also removes the specified index:
#The clear() method empties the list.
#The list still remains, but it has no content.

# Loop list
#You can loop through the list items by using a for loop:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in thislist:
  print(x)

#Use the range() and len() functions to create a suitable iterable
#Print all items by referring to their index number:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for i in range(len(thislist)):
  print(thislist[i]) 

#The iterable created in the example above is [0, 1, 2].

#Print all items, using a while loop to go through all the index numbers
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
i = 0
while i < len(thislist):
  print(thislist[i])
  i = i + 1

#A short hand for loop that will print all items in a list:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
[print(x) for x in thislist]
